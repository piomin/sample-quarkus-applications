In this project I'm demonstrating the most interesting features of [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/) for building applications in Kotlin.

## Getting Started 
Here's a full list of available examples:
1. Using Quarkus for building REST application that connects to H2 database using Hibernate ORM. The example is available in the module [employee-service](https://github.com/piomin/sample-quarkus-applications/tree/master/employee-service). A detailed guide may be find in the following article: [Guide to Quarkus with Kotlin](https://piotrminkowski.com/2020/08/09/guide-to-quarkus-with-kotlin/)
2. Using Quarkus Kubernetes extensions to deploy application easily on Kubernetes. The example is available in the module [employee-service](https://github.com/piomin/sample-quarkus-applications/tree/master/employee-service). A detailed guide may be find in the following article: [Guide to Quarkus on Kubernetes](https://piotrminkowski.com/2020/08/10/guide-to-quarkus-on-kubernetes/)
3. Using Quarkus OAuth2 extension to provide RBAC authorization based on integration with Keycloak. The example is available in the module [employee-secure-service](https://github.com/piomin/sample-quarkus-applications/tree/master/employee-secure-service). A detailed guide may be find in the following article: [Quarkus OAuth2 and security with Keycloak](https://piotrminkowski.com/2020/09/16/quarkus-oauth2-and-security-with-keycloak/)
4. Using Quarkus with SmallRye Graph extension to GraphQL API and integration with a database with Panache. The example is available in the module [sample-app-graphql](https://github.com/piomin/sample-quarkus-applications/tree/master/sample-app-graphql). A detailed guide may be found in the following article: [An Advanced GraphQL with Quarkus](https://piotrminkowski.com/2021/04/14/advanced-graphql-with-quarkus/)
